This is a simple reminder app built with React and Hono.

To run the app, go into each directory and run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`.

If I had more time, I would:

- Instead of a local sqlite db, use a cloud postgres db
- Add authentication
- Style it a bit more
- Use Tanstack Query to fetch and cache the reminders
- Add delete reminder functionality
- Add feature to edit reminders
- Add feature to mark reminders as completed
- Add feature to snooze reminders
- Add feature to reschedule reminders
